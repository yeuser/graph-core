# Graph-core

## Introduction
This project is the core library to projectile an optimized and traversable mega-graph of nodes.


## Main Requirement Vision
1. The graph should easily hold 100,000 nodes and 10,000 edges per node
2. The traversal of the graph nodes should take place in a linear fashion relative to the number of the edges traversed
3. This tool should provide the facility to run graph queries and filters
4. This project must be responsible of persisting the graph changes through writers given
